# Web Page Creation

Hello everyone! 👋

Welcome to this exciting project where to build a simple landing page, following a provided design. Here I tell you the details!

## How am I doing it?

I started by selecting the fonts and colors specified in the original design. My approach was to build the page incrementally, focusing first on the HTML content and then diving into the CSS styling. I customized the content according to my preferences.

## Learnings

### Incremental Development 🛠️

I found that approaching the project section by section made the build process easier. This approach allowed me to maintain a more organized and effective workflow.

### Emphasis on Practice 🚀

The best way to learn is by doing. Building the site from scratch gave me the opportunity to practically apply the knowledge I gained during my apprenticeship.

### Git Repository Management 🔄

I learned that making regular commits is key. Keeping an orderly history not only makes it easier to track changes, but also simplifies collaboration and teamwork.

See you on the next project! 🚀
